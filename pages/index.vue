        <p>Glicko (also Glicko2) is a rating system to assess a player's strength in a 1v1 game. It was invented by Mark Glickman as an extension of the popular Elo rating system.</p>
        <p>Although, this site won't go to much into the history of Glicko/Glicko2. It's primary purpose is to benchmark and serve as a source of reliable libraries for people to utilize across multiple languages.</p>
        <p>Contributions are always appreciated. If you'd like to contribute to the benchmarks, you can do so <a href="https://github.com/Glicko2/benchmarking" target="_blank">here</a>. If you'd like to contribute to the main site, you can do so <a href="https://github.com/Glicko2/glicko2.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
